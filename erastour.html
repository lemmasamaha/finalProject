            <p>Taylor announced the Eras Tour on November 1, 2022, which has been a highly anticipated event for her fans. It has been a long five years since her last tour and during that time she released 3 new albums and 2 re-recordings, so needless to say this tour has been packed with all of her hits and everyone wants a ticket.</p>

            <h2>Getting Tickets</h2>

                <p>Due to the immense anticipation surrounding the Eras Tour, many fans registered with Ticketmaster's Verfied Fan program to have the chance to purchase tickets in advance. The idea was that you select your preferred concert date and if you're selected by TicketMaster you'll get a pre-sale code to use on November 15th to buy tickets to your show. However, it appeared that a large number of people got presale codes that day causing there to be multiple queues of over 2000 people waiting to purchase tickets. I recall my sister waking me up at 8:00 am, and we anxiously sat in front of our laptops, waiting for our turn in the queue  so that we could finally select our tickets.</p>

                <img class="resize" src="images/queue.jpg" alt="Queue displaying number of people ahead of you"></img>

                <p>It seems that not everyone was able to get tickets. In fact, some tickets got into the hands of resellers who saw the demand and tried to resell at unbelievable prices. For example, floor seats were selling for $10,000 and the nosebleeds were selling around $5000. If that seemed crazy enough, it only gets crazier. There were even videos showing scammers attempting to sell people "tickets" that were outside of the stadium. However, there were many attempts to resolve this solution, such as some people receiving emails telling them they have another opportunity to buy tickets.</p>
                
            
            <h2>Surprise Songs</h2>

                <p>At the opening night of the Eras Tour, we learned that she sings 44 songs from her vast discography. As the concert went on there was a section that she introduced where she'll sing 2 surprise songs that will vary for every concert. While this is a fun idea, it also leaves other swifties scared that she'll play some of her most iconic songs when they aren't there. Sadly, I have been one of those people on April 1st, she sang "Death by a Thousand Cuts" and "Clean" and on the 14th she sang "The Great War" and "You're on You Own, Kid" both of these losses devastated me greatly.</p>

                <p>It looks like there wil be exceptions to this rule though. The first is if she messes up on a song she will replay at another time in the tour. The second rule is that if any of the surprise songs are off of her Midnights album she gets to repeat them as often as she likes. Thankfully, she messed up on both "Death By a Thousand Cuts" and "Clean" so we know she'll replay them at another point (I'm just hoping that it'll be in Detroit).</p>

            <h2>The Setlist</h2>

            <p>As I mentioned before there are 44 songs on the setlist and it takes her 3 hours to sing them all, but I'm going to provide her setlist from opening night: </p>
