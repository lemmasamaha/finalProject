            <h2>Re-recordings</h2>

                <p> Taylor Swift has been re-recording her albums as a way to regain control over her original music catalog and if you didn't know this was happening I'll fill you in on why it's important. Back in 2019 Scott Borchetta (founder of Big Machine Records), orchestrated a deal with Scooter Braun (founder of Ithaca Holdings LLC) that gave him total ownership and control of her first six albums (Debut to Reputation). Prior to this deal Taylor voiced her concerns to Scott Borchetta claiming that Scooter had bullied her in the past.</p>

                <p>Now what does it mean for Taylor since she lost ownership of her albums? She would still receive the profits from royalties due to radio airplay, streaming services, and live performances, but she had no control over how her music was used for licensing purposes such as TV shows, movies, commercials, etc. In response to her music being sold she made the decision to re-record her first six albums, to regain control of her life's work and to receive fair compensation for work. 
                </p>

                <p>That's why on this site you'll see "Taylor's Version" next to the albums she has already re-recorded. We already have her version of Fearless and Red, but now she's been dropping easter eggs that the next album she'll be re-recording is Speak Now. Now that you're caught up, the rule is if there's a "Taylor's Version" we only listen to that version, so no one can profit off her work. </p>
            
            <h2>Taylor in Academia</h2>
            
                <p>On May 18th, 2022 she received an honorary doctorate in the fine arts from NYU (New York University). She accepted her degree and gave a 22 minute speech, where she discussed life lessons she learned from music industry.</p> 

                <p>There were some anecdotes from her speech that managed to become relevant again in August 2022. These are some of the quotes, "As long as we are fortunate enough to be breathing, we will breathe through, breathe deep and breathe out. And I am a doctor now, so I know how breathing works." and "Scary news is: You're on your own now. Cool news is: You're on your own now". These quotes referenced two songs from her Midnights album, "Labyrinth" and "You're on Your Own, Kid". Of course, once she announced her Midnights album we were able to connect the dots.</p>

                <p>In addition to receiving an honorary degree from NYU, the university also offered a class about her at the Cline Davis Institue, where they covered her evolution as a musician.</p>

            <h2>Easter Eggs</h2>

                <p>Finally, if there's one thing to know about her, it's that she is known for leaving easter eggs in music videos, Instagram posts, speeches, and more. We talked about some of them above, such as dropping lyrics from her unreleased album in her NYU speech, and hints from her music videos that she'll be re-recording Speak Now next. You might think it's crazy to constantly dissect everything she does and I agree with you! But you have to admit it's an interesting and new way to interact with her fans.</p>
            
            <h2>Learn More</h2>

                <p>If you're feeling like you haven't learned enough, which is understandable because there's a lot to unpack, you should watch her documentary "Miss Americana" on Netflix. You might've felt a certain way about her before, but I can promise that watching this documentary will change your perception of her. You can take my word for it because the same thing happened to me and now I'm building an entire website about her.</p>
