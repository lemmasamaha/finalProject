    <p> My name is Lemma Samaha and I'm a computer science major with a minor in UX design at the University of Michigan. Outside of school I love discovering new movies, TV shows, and music, so I created this site to share some of my favorites with you!</p>

    <h2>Where I've Been</h2>
    <h3>Palestine</h3>
    <p>One of the favorite places I've been to is Palestine. Whenever my family visits, we stay with my mom's side of the family and visit places like Akko, Jerusalem, and Haifa. My cousins and I stay up all night playing cards, while we catch up on everything that's happened since we last saw each other.</p>

    <h3>Hawaii</h3>
    <p>Another one of my favorite places is Hawaii. I went recently over spring break and it's quite literally paradise on Earth. We went snorkeling, whale watching, and did Road to Hana. Definitely a place to see in your lifetime, but make sure to "respect the 'aina".</p>
